A takeaway I have had during my first few lessons is to take the time to read everything. This hasn't been discussed but it is listed in the self assessment part of the homework. I find that I want to rush through things but focusing on reading all of the directions helps me to slow down.
My second takeaway is working on my time management and focusing on what I need to do to succeed.
The first strategy I am focusing on during the rest of Mod 0 is calendaring and planning what I need to do daily for homework and preparing for the next session.
My second strategy is to practice problem solving and writing things out.
